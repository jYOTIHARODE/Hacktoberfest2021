Question: Sort_the_Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent,
with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

Let's Code...

class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& nums) {
        int high=nums.size()-1;
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        
        while(mid<=high){
            switch(nums[mid]){
                case 0:
                    swap(nums[low++],nums[mid++]);
                    break;
                case 1:
                    mid++;
                    break;
                case 2:
                    swap(nums[mid],nums[high--]);
                    break;    
            }
        }
    }
};
